# PHP TOMBOLA Application

This PHP application demonstrates my OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) skills by implementing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using a custom CRUD class. The application uses a database to store and retrieve data, and it includes features such as DataTable integration for listing data, AJAX requests for seamless data retrieval, and various functionalities for managing users, raffles, and raffle tickets.
